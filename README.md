# Typing-Speed-Test-Application
The Typing Speed Test Application is a Python-based project designed to measure a user's typing speed in terms of Words Per Minute (WPM). The application features a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library. It challenges the user to type a randomly selected text, calculates the typing speed dynamically.

## Key Features:
Random Text Selection:

The application selects a random sentence from a pre-loaded file (text.txt) for the user to type.
Real-Time Typing Speed (WPM) Calculation:

The WPM (Words Per Minute) is calculated dynamically as the user types, providing immediate feedback on typing speed.
Typing Accuracy Feedback:

The text typed by the user is color-coded:
Green indicates correct typing.
Red indicates incorrect typing.
Start and Restart Functionality:

The application allows users to start the test, where the typing timer begins. After completion, users can restart with a new sentence, resetting the speed and accuracy calculations.
GUI Components:

Labels: Display instructions, the target text, and typing speed.
Entry Widget: An input field where the user types the text.
Buttons:
Start: Initiates the typing test.
Restart: Allows restarting the test after completion.
